// Task:
// A magician in the subway showed you a trick, he put an ice brick in a bottle to impress you.The bricks width and height are equal, forming a square. Just for fun and also to impress the magician and people around, you decided to calculate the brick's volume. Write a function iceBrickVolume that will except these parameters:

// radius - bottle's radius (always > 0);
// bottleLength - total bottle length (always > 0);
// rimLength - length from bottle top to brick (always < bottleLength);
// And return volume of ice brick that magician managed to put into a bottle.

// illustration

// Note:
// All inputs are integers. Assume no irregularities to the cuboid brick. You may assume the bottle is shaped like a cylinder. The brick cannot fit inside the rim.

// All inputs are integers.

// Examples:
// iceBrickVolume(1, 10, 2); // => 16
// iceBrickVolume(5, 30, 7); // => 1150

function iceBrickVolume(radius, bottleLength, rimLength) {
  return (bottleLength - rimLength) * radius ** 2 * 2;
}

// Best practice and clever solution:

// const iceBrickVolume = (r, x, y) => 2 * r * r * (x - y);
